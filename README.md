## This is the GR-Ramses Gitlab repository.

This is a modified version of Ramses code which implements GR equations for N-body cosmological simulations. It features a fully constrained formulation of GR in which 10 elliptic equations are solved for the gravitational field. For more details check [our paper][1].

Ramses is an open source code to model astrophysical systems, featuring self-gravitating, magnetised, compressible,
radiative fluid flows. It is based  on the Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR)  technique on a  fully-threaded graded octree. 
[ramses](https://bitbucket.org/rteyssie/ramses) is written in  Fortran 90 and is making intensive use of the Message 
Passing Interface (MPI) library.

Download the code by cloning the git repository using 
```
$ git clone https://bitbucket.org/rteyssie/ramses
```
